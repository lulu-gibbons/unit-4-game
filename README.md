# Crystal Game


# How the game works:

The player is shown a random number at the start of the game that they have to guess by clicking the crystals.
Each crystal has a randomly generated number assigned to it that changes after each round. 
Each time the player clicks a crystal, the new guess will be added to the total number score. 
The player must guess until the 'Total Guess' adds up to the 'Number To Match'.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
